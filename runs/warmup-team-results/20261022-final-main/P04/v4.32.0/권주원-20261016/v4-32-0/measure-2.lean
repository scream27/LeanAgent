# Fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations

The key took in variational calculus is:
```
∀ h, ∫ x, f x * h x = 0 → f = 0
```
which allows use to go from reasoning about integrals to reasoning about functions.

## Overview of variational calculus

The variational calculus API in Physlib is designed to match and formalize the physicists intuition
of variational calculus. It is not designed to be a general API for variational calculus.

Within variational caclulus we are interested in function transformations, `F : (X → U) → (Y → V)`.
In physics this functional is often of the form `L : (Time → U) → Time → ℝ`,
which represents the Lagrangian of a system. We will use this to explain the formalization
within this API.

The action is nominally given by
$$S[u] = \int L(u, t) dt,$$
however it is convenient to
introduce another function `φ` and define the action as
$$S[u] = \int φ(t) L(u, t) dt.$$
In the end we will set `φ := fun _ => 1`.

We now consider $$\frac{\partial}{\partial s} S[u + s * \delta u]$$ at `s = 0`,
which is the variational derivative of `S` at `u` in the direction `δu`.
This is equal to
$$
\int φ(t) * \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial s} L(u + s * \delta u, t)\right|_{s = 0}dt
$$
Let us denote the function
$$
\delta u,\, t \mapsto \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial s} L(u + s * \delta u, t)\right|_{s = 0}
$$ as `Lᵤ : (Time → U) → (Time → ℝ)`.
Then the variational derivative is
$$\int φ (t) Lᵤ(δu, t) dt.$$

It may then be possible to find a function `Gᵤ : (Time → ℝ) → Time → U`
such that
$$
\int φ(t) Lᵤ(δu, t) dt = \int \langle Gᵤ(φ, t), δu(t)\rangle dt
$$
This is usually done by integration by parts.

We now set `φ := fun _ => 1` and get `grad u := Gᵤ (fun _ => 1)`, which is the
variational gradient at `u`. The Euler–Lagrange equations, for example, are then `grad u = 0`.

In our API, the relationship between
- `Lᵤ` and `Gᵤ` is captured by the `HasVarAdjoint`.
- `L` and `Gᵤ` by `HasVarAdjDeriv`.
- `L` and `grad u` by `HasVarGradientAt`.

In practice we assume that `L` has a certain locality property
`IsLocalizedFunctionTransform`, which allows us to work with functions
`φ` and `δu` which have compact support.

This API assumes that `U` is an inner-product space. This can be considered as the full
configuration space, or a local chart thereof.

/-- A version of `fundamental_theorem_of_variational_calculus'` for `Continuous f`.
The proof uses assumption that source of `f` is finite-dimensional
inner-product space, so that a bump function with compact support exists via
`ContDiffBump.hasCompactSupport` from `Analysis.Calculus.BumpFunction.Basic`.

The proof is by contradiction, assume that there is `x₀` such that `f x₀ ≠ 0` then one construct
construct `g` test function *supported* on the neighborhood of `x₀` such that `⟪f x, g x⟫ ≥ 0`
and `⟪f x, g x⟫ > 0` on a neighborhood of x₀.

Using `Y` for the theorem below to make use of bump functions in InnerProductSpaces. `Y` is
a finite dimensional measurable space over `ℝ` with (standard) inner product.
